# Tecra Knight Code repository

Hello, I'm Ahza Fatah Ar-Rayyan, and I take great pride in being a crucial member of the Tecra Knights robotics team as their programmer. With a strong and unwavering passion for robotics and programming, I've been contributing my expertise to this team for 1 and a half year. I specialize in developing and fine-tuning the software that powers our robots, ensuring they function flawlessly during competitions and real-world applications. In my role, I've had the opportunity to work with a wide range of cutting-edge technologies, including Java programming language, and I relish the challenge of solving complex problems and optimizing our robots' performance.

Beyond my programming skills, I'm also deeply enthusiastic about learning new thing, which has further fueled my commitment to this field. As a member of this team, I'm always eager to collaborate with fellow robotics enthusiasts and share our experiences and knowledge to push the boundaries of what's possible in the exciting world of robotics. It's a pleasure to introduce myself to you as Tecra Knight, a dedicated and innovative robotic team programmer.

You can find our robot code here when its during powerplay season and also center stage season

You can conveniently access our team's robot code on our dedicated repository during the Powerplay season, where we've meticulously documented and optimized every aspect of our robot's programming. This repository serves as a valuable resource for our fellow robotic enthusiasts and competitors alike, offering insights into our coding techniques, algorithms, and strategies that power our robot to excel in the high-stakes challenges of Powerplay.

Additionally, during the Center Stage season, we continue to keep our code repository up-to-date with the latest developments and enhancements. We believe in the importance of knowledge sharing and transparency, so you'll find a wealth of information on how we adapt and fine-tune our robot for the unique demands of Center Stage competitions, showcasing our commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's achievable in the realm of robotics.

Feel free to explore our code, learn from our experiences, and engage with us in meaningful discussions about robotics and programming. Our repository is not only a testament to our dedication but also an open invitation to join us in our journey to advance the state of the art in robotic technology during both the Powerplay and Center Stage seasons.
